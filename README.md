# Thankser

Thankser is a slackbot that says "thank you" in various languages. When just saying a simple "thanks" isn't enough, add some novelty by using a different tongue.

## Features

* Returns the translation of "thank you" in a specified language.
* Returns one of a number of responses when asked for a snarky translation.
* Provides a listing of the languages it knows.
* Logs requested languages that it doesn't know.
* Provides usage.

## Installation

1. Deploy Thankser somewhere.
1. Create the Slack app in your workspace.


## Usage

You can call Thankser from Slack, a browser, or the command line.

### From Slack

After you install Thankser in your Slack workspace, you call Thankser by invoking the following slash command:
 
    /ty

To find out how to say "thank you" in a particular language, you need to identify the language using either the name of the language (like `german`) or the two-letter [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code (like `de`).

For example:

    /ty german
    /ty de

You can also find out which languages Thankser knows by typing the following command:

    /ty ?

Finally, if you want to thank someone directly, you can @mention them following the language you want. You can @mention as many people as you'd like to thank.

For example:

    /ty german @SlackUser

### From a browser

To call Thankser from a browser, access the following URLs:

    https://thankser.herokuapp.com/say-thanks?text=
    https://thankser.herokuapp.com/say-thanks?text=?
    https://thankser.herokuapp.com/say-thanks?text=german

To see which unknown languages users have requested, access the following URL:

    https://thankser.herokuapp.com/show-unknown-languages

### From a command line

To call Thankser from the command line:

    $ curl -d "text=german" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://thankser.herokuapp.com/say-thanks
    $ curl https://thankser.herokuapp.com/show-unknown-languages
    
## Adding new languages

To add new languages to Thankser, modify the [`thankses.json`](https://github.com/gallimorej/thankser/blob/master/data/thankses.json) file and redeploy Thankser. 

## Origin of Thankser
The idea for Thankser originated from some feedback I received from a colleague. She told me she and others really appreciated it when I said "thank you" after they had done something to support me. She said I was "pretty good" about doing that. Maybe even better than most. But "pretty good" isn't good enough. I needed to be better at the basics. Building Thankser was a way for me to internalize that feedback. It's hard for me to forget to say thank you now when I've spent so much time building an app that does just that.

The fact that I could even build this at all is a credit to [Gene Kim's](https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim) efforts in teaching me. In addition to learning the Clojure language, it's been a long time since I've coded anything so I had a lot to learn about lots of stuff to even get "hello, world" working. But I had a lot of fun learning. Thanks to Gene for sharing his time, talents, and knowledge to make me productive in an IDE again.
